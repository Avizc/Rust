# The Rust Programming Language

The book can be found online [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/). It's an amazing resource and I highly recommend it.

I also recommend following the community and members of it on Twitter. Following them quietly for the last few years and seeing the development really has solidified my belief that Rust is most definitely worth it.
