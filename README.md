# Avi's Adventure in Rustland

I'm learning Rust (again), see what I'm up to.

## Motivation

I decided to learn Rust a few years ago but in the end didn't completely follow through. Since then I've kept up with news on Rust and the community but didn't attempt to go back into it.

So here I am doing that now.

My primary resource this time will be the second edition of [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/).
