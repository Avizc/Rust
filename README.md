## Synopsis
I am learning Rust, see what I'm up to.

## Motivation
For two years I haven't coded. In high school my code was the xkcd burning bus example (http://xkcd.com/1695/).
I'm now working on a new project where Rust may be useful. Hence why I've decided to learn it.

This is where I am getting all of my information from:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/

## Who is driving the burning bus here
Avi Z.
